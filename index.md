## My Journey

**Early Years (2005-2014)**
I started programming at age 12 with Visual Basic, driven by curiosity about how websites work. This led me to explore PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, eventually becoming a recognized plugin and template developer in the PHPWind community.

**CTO Experience (2015-2019)**
Joined Êô∫Ëâ∫ÂàõÊÉ≥ in Chengdu as CTO, where I architected and maintained [ThinkSNS](https://thinksns.com), generating millions in annual revenue. Led development teams on major projects including:

- ÊµôÊ±üÂç´ËßÜ - ‰∏≠ÂõΩËìù App backend & admin system
- [Huawei Xinsheng Community + Huawei Weibo](https://xinsheng.huawei.com)
