I started to get involved in development when I was about 12 years old.
The first programming language I came into contact with was VB. At that time,
the Internet in China was not well developed. Out of a child's curiosity,
I used a website building tool to create my first website.

Therefore, I began to turn to PHP and HTML/CSS/JavaScript learning and used
them to modify my own website.

Then (around 2009), I came into contact with PHPWind (a forum building project)
and have been making plug-ins and templates in the community.
I became a well-known plug-in and template developer in the PHPWind community at that time.

Time came to January 2015, I left Shenzhen and came to Chengdu.
I joined 「智艺创想」 and served as CTO and obtained a certain equity.
I mainly developed and maintained [ThinkSNS](https://thinksns.com).
All the coding and open source marketing of the project were completed
by me and brought millions of profits to the company every year.

During his tenure, in addition to [ThinkSNS](https://thinksns.com)
i was fully responsible for the open source project.
He also led the team to complete several large projects:

* 浙江卫视 - 中国蓝 App 后端 + 管理后台
* [华为心声社区＋华为微博](https://xinsheng.huawei.com)
* 美的集团社区

> There are others, but I'm only listing a few of the larger ones.

Four years have passed in a flash (2019). For some unspeakable reasons,
I left 「智艺创想」 and started my own business (Odroe Inc.), and my entrepreneurial direction is open source.

So far, my successful open source projects are:

* [Prisma Dart](https://prisma.pub) - Prisma Client Dart is an auto-generated type-safe ORM. It uses Prisma Engine as the data access layer and is as consistent as possible with the Prisma Client JS/TS APIs.
* [Spry](spry.fun) - A lightweight, composable Dart web framework designed to work collaboratively with various runtime platforms.

## How It's Going

I am currently the CEO and engineer at Odroe. I spend most of my time
maintaining customer relationships, producing open source software,
and serving and developing for my customers.

## Technology

* Programming languages: Dart, JS/TS, Rust, Zig, Swift, CSS/HTML
* Frameworks: Flutter, Vue/Nuxt.js, React/Next.js, Svelte/SvelteKit, Nest.js, Express/Koa, Spry, Tailwind CSS amd more...
* Others: Prisma, Docker, tokio, Zed, Git and more...
